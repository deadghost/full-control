full-control
============

A clojurescript Web UI DSL based on Om and Bootstrap.

Proof of Concept. This repository contains a working prototype.

You can see it working with this little [demo](http://www.roboli.space/full-control) application.

#### Motivation

### The problem

Frontend development is hard. It's even harder if you don't have the rigth tools. Of course, if what you're working on it's no more than a form, some inputs and a button, you can rely on whatever you see fit. But its not always the case, and when you're programming a big or complex application, one must recur to third party libraries to acelerate the process. Third party libraries where almost all of them, not only they aren't free but they are expensive. But why frontend development is so hard? Part of the problem relies on its technologies. Take HTML for example, what was designed to describe documents it is now use to describe controls/widgets. And there are so many libraries, tools, toolkits and frameworks to use, where each one try their best to encapsulate all those complexities and try their best to create a layer of abstraction, but most often than not, you end up distracted, you end up investing more time writing code that has nothing to do with the logic of your application.

TODO: Explain examples.
